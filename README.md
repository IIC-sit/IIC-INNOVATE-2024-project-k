## Project Description

Solution Overview:Eco Sense combines AI/ML, IoT, and biotechnology to tackle waste management and food spoilage. It uses microbial-powered community disposal stations and IoT-enabled smart packaging to create a sustainable ecosystem, reducing landfill waste and minimizing food spoilage.

Detailed Solution:
Microbial-Powered Disposal Stations: Uses microbes to biodegrade plastics and organic waste at community hubs. AI assists in waste classification and provides insights on waste accumulation.
IoT-Enabled Smart Packaging: Biodegradable packaging with IoT sensors detects spoilage indicators, sending alerts via a mobile app, allowing users to manage food before spoilage.
Cloud-Based Analytics: Aggregates data from disposal stations and sensors for analysis, offering insights on waste patterns and environmental impact.
Mobile Application: Acts as an interface, notifying users about food nearing expiry, station locations, and waste reduction tips, with a rewards system for responsible behavior.

How it Addresses the ProblemEcoSense offers real-time solutions for waste reduction and food spoilage, helping communities and consumers adopt sustainable habits.
